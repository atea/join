# Welcome to Git for Atea Norge

## 1 - request service  

If you're an Atea employee access can be ordered through [Service Market](https://servicemarket.atea.com/). Go to "Request" and then "Service". Search for "GitHub", put the product in your shopping cart and press "Next". Access will be automatically granted after your manager has approved the request.


## 2 - private GitHub account  

If you don't already have a private GitHub-account, create one. Make sure you add your full name in the account, add 2FA (multi factor authentication), and add and verify your Atea-mail (if you use private mail for your github account).  

[GitHub guide to add and verify mail](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/verifying-your-email-address) 

## 3 - connect your GitHub account to Atea's GitHub space  

After your "Service Market" request has been approved and completed <b>(1)(2)</b>:  
Make sure you are logged in to your private GitHub-account. Go to this address: https://github.com/orgs/ateanorge/sso - this will lead you to Atea O365 SSO, which connects your private account to your Atea O365 account.

<b>(1)</b> - You should receive two e-mails: 'Approved' og 'Complete' - make sure you received both e-mails

<b>(2)</b> - Might take everything from some minutes to some hours from completed request, to O365 user acoount is synchronized, if it doesn't work right away after approval, just wait a bit and try again.
